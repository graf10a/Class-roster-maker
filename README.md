# Class-roster-maker

*Makes the class roster for the Instant Classroom name generator.*

*Language:* R

The purpose of the Jupyter notebook (R kernel) included in this repository is to extract students' first and last names from a gradebook file downloaded from Blackboard in the coma separated format. The output is generated in the form of a text file containig students' first and last names separated by comas, for instance:

*Paul Johnson, John Smith, Mary Van der Waals*

The list of names is to be used as an input on 
__[Instant Classroom name generator](https://www.superteachertools.us/myclassroom/?groupid=135410&groupfolder=)__ web-site.

The repository contains the following files:

'Name_generator_input.ipynb' -- the Jupyter notebook file (R kernel).
'README.md' -- this file.
'roster.csv' -- a sample of Blackboard gradebook file included for demonstration purposes. The file contains some fake students' data and it can be run smoothly with the notebook file.
